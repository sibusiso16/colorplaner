Title: ggplot2 Extenstion to Visualize Two Variables Per Color Aesthetic through Color Space Projection
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Date: 2016-07-22
Author: William Murphy

Description: Add additional dimensionality to visualizations by using the color
 and/or fill aesthetics to convey the values of two continous variables each. By
 projecting variable values onto YUV colorspace, a scale is created that allows
 viewers to intuitively determine the values of both variables from the single
 displayed color. Includes two new scales and a new guide for ggplot2.
